# `S.H.I.K.W.A â€“ Studentâ€™s Helpline for Improving Knowledge - Wisdom Approach`

A studentâ€™s normal day to day life is full of stress. Be it the stress of meeting deadlines or meet the expectations of family, friends and teachers. As a result, a large number of students especially in their Pre-University or College Days are prone to getting into depression mostly because they don't have anyone to ask for help or they are hesitant in asking for it.

This Project S.H.I.K.W.A â€“ Studentâ€™s Helpline for Improving Knowledge - Wisdom Approach is aimed at helping college students. The platform will allow the students to share their queries, feelings and thoughts with other students, teachers and mentors and so that they can help each other and be a better version of themselves.ðŸ’–
